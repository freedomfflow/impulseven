                <p>ImpulSeven is an all-in-one DeFi ecosystem that offers a range of products in one user-friendly
                    platform. Built on the Ethereum blockchain and powered by the ERC-20 i7 token, ImpulSeven is on a
                    mission to make DeFi accessible to everyone by offering an easy-to-use platform that maintains the
                    highest standards of transparency, security and reliability. Furthermore, it simplifies monetary
                    transactions by offering an alternative to expensive middlemen and third-party intermediaries.</p>
                <p>The DApps available on ImpulSeven include a state-of-the art decentralized exchange, AI-based
                    arbitrage trading bots, a lending platform, decentralized recurring billing, yield farming, staking
                    rewards and more!</p>
                <h3>ABOUT IMPULSEVEN:</h3>
                <p>Before DeFi, financial transactions were reliant on the centralized custodial services of banks and
                    other financial institutions. The involvement of these institutions was necessary to mitigate the
                    counter-party risk (the risk that an asset is not received after it is paid for) that exists while
                    funds or other assets are exchanged. These institutions also exist in the crypto industry, in the
                    form of centralized exchanges and trading platforms. However, the inclusion of third parties and
                    middlemen exposes transactions to exuberant fees and extra risks.</p>
                <p>While these institutions are still heavily utilized, the increasing use of cryptocurrencies and smart
                    contracts makes trustless transactions a viable option. This decreases the reliance on these legacy
                    systems and gives the market more control over how they move their assets. ImpulSeven seeks to
                    promote widespread adoption of these trustless mechanisms for conducting even the most complex
                    transactions without reliance on middlemen, or the risk of being held hostage by third-party
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>ImpulSeven is built on the well-established Ethereum protocol. It is powered by its native ERC-20
                    token, i7, which plays a vital role within the ImpulSeven ecosystem. As the name suggests, there are
                    seven key components to the platform:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ImpulSeven DEX</li>
                    <li>Liquidity Mining and Staking Rewards</li>
                    <li>DeFi Lending</li>
                    <li>Ai Arbitrage Trading Bot</li>
                    <li>Decentralized Recurring Billing</li>
                    <li>Governance</li>
                    <li>i7 Token</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The products and services offered by ImpulSeven are based on the strong foundations formed by its
                    decentralized exchange (DEX). This DEX allows for non-custodial, cross-chain, peer-to-peer
                    transactions by utilizing smart contracts—a function that forms the basis of all DeFi applications,
                    including the 7 different services offered on ImpulSeven.</p>
                <p>To ensure accessibility to everyone irrespective of their prior experience with cryptocurrencies,
                    ImpulSeven has designed an intuitive, user-friendly interface for all its products. Users can access
                    all aspects of the ImpulSeven ecosystem through a single dashboard with customizable features. This
                    is the crucial differentiator that sets it apart from other DeFi solutions that use barebones,
                    complex interfaces that overwhelm newcomers.

                        platform and receives a portion of the fees earnt, as well as rewards in the form of tokens.
                        Investors can choose to either withdraw their initial capital at any time or after a fixed

                        be instrumental in helping the project evolve. The list of supported assets for Liquidity Mining
                        will be announced soon.</p>
                    <p>ImpulSeven also supports staking of i7 tokens via its website. The staking mechanism on the
                        platform is designed to return 80% of fees generated from all i7 transactions as dividends, to
                        be shared between all the stakers. These dividends start accumulating the moment i7 tokens are
                        staked, and dividend payouts are made once every 3 days. The dividend earned will compounded,
                        gradually increasing the amount of staked i7 tokens.</p>
                    <h3>DeFi Lending On ImpulSeven</h3>
                    <p>DeFi lending is one of the most important developments that have come from the space, and plays
                        an important role in providing liquidity to individuals and businesses. Compared to traditional
                        banking where users need to go through an arduous documentation process to prove their
                        creditworthiness, DeFi loans require nothing more than adequate collateral. Borrowers can take
                        loans in fiat or stablecoins, and collateral can be posted in a range of accepted
                        cryptocurrencies. The liquidity for lending is generally provided by other participants in the
                        network who will deposit their funds into a lending pool governed by a smart contract. By
                        contributing to the lending pool, investors earn interest on their deposits.</p>
                    <p>The smart contracts governing the lending process implement fail-safes to reduce the risks that
                        come with a default or a drastic fall in the value of collateral. To do this, borrowers
                        sometimes need to provide additional collateral if market conditions change significantly.
                        Failure to maintain an adequate level of collateralization can result in liquidation if the
                        value falls below a certain level. Similarly, an increase in the value of crypto assets held as
                        collateral <b>makes the borrower eligible for additional loans against the existing
                            collateral.</b></p>
                    <p>The ImpulSeven Lending platform is a decentralized solution for individuals and businesses alike.
                        Users can borrow stablecoins through the platform after depositing a variety of crypto assets as
                        collateral. The platform offers added convenience by charging borrowers low interest rates, and
                        investors involved in staking or contributing tokens towards the lending pool also earn passive
                        income through interest and rewards.</p>
                    <h3>Ai Arbitrage Trading Bot</h3>
                    <p>As one of the core products in the ImpulSeven ecosystem, the Arbitrage Trading Bots use
                        artificial intelligence to leverage the varying prices of crypto assets across different
                        decentralized exchanges to execute profitable cross-platform trades. While the principles behind
                        arbitrage trading are not new and numerous trading bots are already available in the market,
                        none function in a decentralized setting quite like ImpulSeven’s.</p>
                    <p>ImpulSeven’s Arbitrage Trading Bot will monitor different decentralized exchanges to identify
                        price discrepancies for a particular token pair and capitalize on them by placing profitable
                        trades. By doing so, the Bot will generate quick profits for the trader which are deposited
                        directly into their account. In cases where ImpulSeven’s Arbitrage Trading Bot is working with
                        funds from an investment pool, the profits generated by the bot will be proportionally shared
                        with each investor relative to their percentage contribution to the pool.</p>
                    <p>The ImpulSeven Arbitrage Trading Bot will be powered by a smart contract capable of reading the
                        blockchain from multiple exchanges and identifying the potential to place profitable orders.
                        Once identified, it executes trades synchronously one after another until the conditions change.
                        As soon as the gap between asset prices on different exchanges close, the Bot will stop placing
                        orders. The node application responsible for monitoring and execution of trades will be hosted
                        on a cloud server and connected to different decentralized exchanges using their respective API
                        keys. The bot will be configured for high throughput, capable of executing thousands of
                        transactions per second to take advantage of concurrent opportunities across multiple
                        exchanges.</p>
                    <p>To start using the ImpulSeven Arbitrage Trading Bot, users will simply sign up, deposit funds in
                        the cryptocurrency that they wish to trade and hit the start button. The straightforward sign-up
                        process will require only an email, setting login credentials and verifying the provided email
                        address. Once completed, the bot will do all the heavy lifting and the profits made during the
                        process will be deposited to the user’s account.</p>
                    <h3>Decentralized Recurring Billing</h3>
                    <p>Decentralized Recurring Billing allows users to automatically transfer a fixed amount of
                        cryptocurrency from one wallet to another at regular intervals with the help of a smart
                        contract. Decentralized Recurring Billing is ideal for paying subscriptions for products and
                        services, and is a valuable tool for managing investment portfolios that include crypto SIPs
                        (Systematic Investment Plans), recurring deposits and more. As more and more businesses begin to
                        accept cryptocurrencies, Recurring Billing options will undergo a significant increase in
                        demand.</p>
                    <p>ImpulSeven’s Decentralized Recurring Billing solution implements a flexible smart contract which
                        is designed to efficiently carry our payment distribution and bill collection based on the
                        digital signature dynamics of various accounts. This feature is especially helpful when used
                        with stablecoins, as they exhibit negligible volatility and therefore help users automate
                        transfers without having to worry about disruption of services due to non-payment.</p>
                    <h3>Governance</h3>
                    <p>Decentralization is the core of any DeFi platform. Decentralization means there is no central
                        authority or person governing the operations of the platform and is instead managed through a
                        democratic process facilitated by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Used in the
                        context of decentralized protocols, a DAO comprises a group of users, generally token holders,
                        who interact with each other within a set of programmed rules defined within the smart contract.
                        The participants in the DAO work towards the betterment of the ecosystem by setting community
                        goals and targets through proposals. Eligible participants can then vote on these proposals to
                        reach a consensus, ultimately resulting in a decision on whether to implement the said proposal
                        or not.</p>
                    <p>The functioning of a DAO is akin to that of a company or a corporation, where token holders
                        instead of shareholders have the privilege to vote. In ImpulSeven, i7 acts as a governance
                        token. It represents share in the project that gives proportional voting rights with incentives.
                        The i7 token is transferable and can also be traded against other tokens.</p>
                    <h3>i7 Token</h3>
                    <p>i7 is both a utility and governance token within ImpulSeven, and functions as the primary payment
                        currency for all products and services within the ecosystem. It is an ERC-20 token based on
                        Ethereum with a maximum supply of 10 million. i7 was initially released through a presale and
                        subsequent public sale.</p>
                    <p>Staking and liquidity mining are already available for token holders looking to receive rewards
                        for contributing to the ecosystem.</p>
                    <h3>Supported Wallets</h3>
                    <p>As an ERC-20 token, the i7 token is compatible with any Ethereum-supported browser wallet, such
                        as MetaMask, MEW Wallet etc. ImpulSeven is also developing its own ERC-20 compatible wallet
                        which will give users direct access to DeFi functions like staking and token swaps.</p>

                                <p>Joining ImpuseVen as the COO, Cora brings in over 20 years of experience in
                                    management and communications to the project. She holds management positions in
                                    several key companies in Mauritius and has efficiently managed both domestic and
                                    international brands. As a project in the DeFi space, ImpulseVen will benefit from
                                    her previous experience at the Financial Services Promotion Agency (FSPA) and the
                                    Tender Committee. She is also an entrepreneur credited for co-founding C&S Inc. -- a
                                    communication agency that offers Brand and Communication Development consulting for
                                    prominent companies.</p>
                                <p>With Brand and Integrated Communications as her forte, Cora will play a crucial role
                                    in shaping the success of ImpulseVen by building a strong community and user base.
                                    Her credentials as a certified trainer as well as a pro-active social worker will
                                    further empower the ImpulseVen team and help the project reach those who do not have
                                    access to financial services to benefit from the DeFi revolution.</p>
